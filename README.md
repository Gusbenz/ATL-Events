### Best of the BeltLine

A simple site for discovering/posting about the best of the BeltLine. Add events is all you can
do so far, but that's cool. It's a young site.

We branched off and worked to our skill set.

### How do I work this?

Clone this repo and use nodemon(google it) to get that server up and running (default port 3000)

npm install / update once you cd into this bad boy to make sure you have what
you need.
