##README Project 3

This is the README for Project 3 for WDI ATL 4.

### Best of the BeltLine

A simple site for discovering/posting about the best of the BeltLine. Add events is all you can
do so far, but that's cool. It's a young site.

We branched off and worked to our skill set.

We used Trello and had various meetings.
